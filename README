Anti-Spam Server Proxy Report 
=============================

This is the first release of asspr. Please report any bugs or feature
requests to support@obsidian-studios.com. At the moment asspr has only been
compiled and tested on Linux. With some possible changes to the includes,
it should be able to compile and run on any platform.

INSTALLATION
------------
A Makefile is provided to not only compile but install asspr.

make
make install

and your done.

The last step, make install simply copies asspr to /usr/sbin, and the man page
to /usr/share/man/man8/. Which can be easily changed by modifying the make file.
Or manually moving or placing the files.
